A script for streaming your X11 root window and ALSA output to your
channel in justin.tv .

usage: ./stream.sh $your_jtv_stream_key

NOTE: to get your stream key, go to
http://www.justin.tv/broadcast/adv_other , and click "Show" next to
"Stream Key:" .

NOTE: it is probably clever to dump the command into another script so
that when you start broadcasting you don't give away your stream key.

This script is taken directly from
http://community.justin.tv/forums/showthread.php?t=7479 ; I don't
claim to have figured this out myself.

NOTE: The ffmpeg package in ubuntu doesn't have all the right codecs
installed. I followed these instructions (steps 1, 2, 3, and 5) and
they worked for me:

In case the thread disappears, I put the relevant shell commands in
ubuntu-setup.sh (you will need to run the script as root).
